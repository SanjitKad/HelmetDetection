# Stages of the project

- Labelling and Data Preperation
- Object Detection
- Image Classification

## Stage 1 : Labelling and data preperation : Techniques used to generate Data and sources of initial images
To start off with, as far as I am aware, there was no good annotated dataset for this problem statement. An initial dataset with dashcam images from Hyderabad and Bangalore was found and used from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/manjotpahwa/indian-driving-dataset)

## Stage 2 : Object Detection : Detection of bikes with riders of all orientations and distances from camera

## Stage 3 : Image Classification : Classification of the detected bikes into legal and non-legal

## Results :
